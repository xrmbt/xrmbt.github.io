"You know, I love the fog?"

He didn't answer.

Mercy's beater Ford rattled along the concrete veins of the highway as it veered up, up, up to a cresting wave, the fog lifting---no, rather, the truck peeking up over the fog---for just a brief moment. A beautiful moon hung in the sky, and you could see the quaint showcase of blinding flourescent light emitting from the lonely gas-station-and-hotel-combo of solitary Sonora in the distance, before the truck barrelled back down into that wispy grey void. He reached into his inner right jacket pocket, producing a pack of smokes, Elton Lite Select 250s, and coolly flipped them open, sliding out one cigarette in a mechanical manner as he had tens of thousands of times before, grasping it with his teeth as he slapped it shut and returned it, fumbling in his outer right jacket pocket until he had found the Zippo he had been looking for (jet black, no design). A click and strike later, he inhaled deeply as the flame met the end, then exhaled, sifting a similar phenomenon to the interior of the car as is currently external.

"Can't you roll the window down?"

"I don't like the noise," he rasped. "My car, my rules."

She smiled. "At least you finally said something."

"Keep your mouth shut and drive."

A flickering streetlamp in the distance reminded her of David Lynch. The car passed under it, the rattle of the road serving as the only audible rhythm, the click of his glock against the shoulder holster and punctual inhaling and exhaling of the cigarette occasionally interrupting.
